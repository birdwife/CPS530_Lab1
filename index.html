    <div class="prideTitle"><h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></h1></div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>1813</li>
            <li>Jane Austen's most well known and popular novel, with over 20 million copies sold</li>
            <li>Originally titled First Impressions</li>
            <li>The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness. Its humour lies in its honest depiction of manners, education, marriage, and money during the Regency era in Great Britain.

                Mr. Bennet of Longbourn estate has five daughters, but his property is entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family will be destitute upon his death. Thus it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot. The novel revolves around the importance of marrying for love, not for money or social prestige, despite the communal pressure to make a wealthy match.</li>
            <li>Film adaptations include Pride and Prejudice (2005) starring Keira Knightley, directed by Joseph Wright</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Did not recieve any public reviews until 1821</li>
            <li>Considered to be vaguely autobiographical</li>
            <li>The novel tells the story of Fanny Price, starting when her overburdened family sends her at age ten to live in the household of her wealthy aunt and uncle and following her development into early adulthood. From early on critical interpretation has been diverse, differing particularly over the character of the heroine, Austen's views about theatrical performance and the centrality or otherwise of ordination and religion, and on the question of slavery. </li>
